# STOCK PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING


DESCRIPTION:
Doing analysis on stock price prediction would help me to know the future rates based on the previous stock price available. This prediction would give me better picture whether to buy the share or not. The company that I have worked on is AT&T Communications. The Machine Learning algorithm that I have used is LSTM (Long Short Term Memory). With the help of LSTM, I was able to identify whether the stock price will increase or decrease. It predicts one day ahead value based on the recent 60 days.
